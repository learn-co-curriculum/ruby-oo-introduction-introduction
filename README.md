# Introduction to Object-Orientation in Ruby

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming based on the concept
of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as
attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as
methods). OOP is all about being able to structure code so that its
functionality can be shared throughout the application. This is opposed to
procedural programming (PP), in which you build programs in sequential order and
call methods when you want shared behavior between pages in the application.

We'll be discussing these basics of OOP in Ruby:

* Local variables and instance variables
* Setting instance variables from initialize
* Global variables
* Variable scope
* The `new` class method

Ruby is a powerful object-oriented language used by popular applications. In the
upcoming lessons we'll build the foundational knowledge of OOP to be well on
your way to developing your own!
